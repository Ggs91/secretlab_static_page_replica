## About The Project

This is a study case of my greatest takeaway of this project.

I've learnt a lot while recreating this webpage:

* Creating a parallax effect using pure css and with a leading idea of having it as much performant as possible & with browsers support.
* Managing to get the image logo of the header adapte with the height to the header shrinking / growing.
* A strategy for layout to ease the work for reponsivness.
* Making images keeping their ration while adapting to a hard width container.

But here I chose to only develop my journey to get the **parallax effect** working **the way I wanted to**.
