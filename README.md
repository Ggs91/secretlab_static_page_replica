## About The Project

This is a case styudy of my greatest takeaway of this project.

I've learnt a lot while recreating this webpage:

* Creating a parallax effect using pure css and with a leading idea of having it as much performant as possible & with browsers support.
* Managing to get the image logo of the header adapte with the height to the header shrinking / growing.
* A strategy for layout to ease the work for reponsivness.
* Making images keeping their ration while adapting to a hard width container.

But here I chose to only develop my journey to get the **parallax effect** working **the way I wanted to**.

## Performance-Optimized Parallax Effect with Cross-Browsers Compatibility

### Listening to the page's scroll

#### Bad performance of the `window.scroll` event

### Laying out the elements for the parallax effect

### Moving the image at a different speed when the page scrolls with optimization

### Activate animation on viewport only
